1.  See ones.diff
		Research that helped: https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/device_drivers.html

2.  - The line after fix: *mode = 0666;
		- This line sets the file's permission bits for the device. It was originally set to 0444 or r--r--r--, which only gave read access to all users including the owner (root). 
		The change I made gives the owner of the file permission ot write to it. So the new permission bits are rw-r--r--.

3.	You need to add the .write method to the file_operations struct "ones_fops".

4.	ones_device = device_create(ones_class, NULL, MKDEV(ones_major, 0), NULL, DEVICE_NAME);

Bonus: See newgetpid.diff
