2.	We now see the hello-world image when we run "docker images" becuase the image was just installed. docker ps is still empty because the run command finishes before we can check the docker ps command.

3.	The size is 16 KB.

4.	The -d option runs the container in the background and prints its container ID to the screen.

5.	Nothing to write about.

6.	Not the same. Inside: mnt:[4026532276], outside: mnt:[4026531840]

7. 	The cgroup and user namespaces are the same. The rest are different.

8.	Not the same, uid and gid are root for both. But pid is different.

9.	Yes the namespaces are consistent.

10.	Output of Command:
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo

18: eth0@if19: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default

11.	Nothing to write about.

12.	Compiling statically works. However, the program does not seem to work as it did when used previously; it can't run any commands.

13.	The shell works as intended. The difference is because we are running the shell from centos which is a Linux distribution. This means that it has access to the c libraries and also contains the required binary files for the the commands.
