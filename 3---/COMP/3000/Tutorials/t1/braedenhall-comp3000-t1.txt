1. 
a) lsb_release -a: to check linux distribution, uname -a: to check kernel version
b) which <shell> (i.e bash) to find the binary path
c) free --mega to see information about memory in megabytes, lscpu to view info abou the cpu

2.
which: returns the pathname of the executable file passed as argument.
pwd: prints the name of the current/working directory.
who: prints info about the currently logged in user.
whoami: prints username associated with the current user id.
whereis: locates the binary, source and manual pages for the argument command.

3. You can see whether a command internal or external you can use the 'type' command (hashed means external).
man: /usr/bin/man
which: /usr/bin/which
whereis: /usr/bin/whereis

4. man -7 environ: to see documentation.
export PATH=$PATH(pwd): to add temporary path variables
to make the change permanent you canadd the previous line to the .bashrc file

5. All of the commands I listsed in question 3 are owned by root and in group root.
This can be found using the ls -l command on the specific program binary.

6. permission bits define the access level that different users/groups have when using the file.
The first 3 are for the file user, the next 3 are for the owner's group, and the last 3 are for everyone else.

7. /etc/passwd: owner=root, group=root, permissions: owner can read and write, group and everyone else can only read the file. Used to change the user password and stores the passwords.
/etc/shadow: owner=root, group=shadow, permissions: owner can read and write, group can only read, everyone else has no access permissions to the file. Stores the encrypted passwords.

8. This means that you have permission to change to that directory and access its files.

9. The -l option for the ls command is used to see permission bits as well as owner and group.
The -a option can be used to see all the hidden files in a directory.
The file/directory can be made hidden by starting the name with the '.' symbol.
