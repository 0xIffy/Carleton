<h2>SQL Queries</h2>
<p>In this assignment you will get practice doing sql queries.</p>
<p>Problem 1 consists of some  questions relating to the telephone
switching
database we have examined before. It stores information about
subscribers, lines, trunks, calls in progress, services lines subscribe
to, routing information used by trunks. This question is intended as practice for the final exam which will have SQL query questions related to this data. You need to answers the
query questions using SQL.</p>
<p>The background material for this assignment are the videos entitled SQL 1 and SQL 2 and the SQL examples from the SQL section of the course notes. Also the thinking for solving these problems is the same as that demonstrated in the videos on Relational Algebra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 1: SQL Queries</h2>
<p>The course notes provides an example sqlite database <span class="code">telephone_switch_rev4.db</span> that you must use for this question. Here are some more details about this database.</p>
<p>The video Telephone Database Rev 4 on the course schedule website walks you through the scenario, ER model, and schema for this database.</p>
<p>Digit translations during a call works like this.
The dialled digits are entered into the call table
along
with the originator information (portid, channel). Then the dialled
digits
are used to find the terminator which could be a line, a trunk, or
a treatment.
</p>
<p>Choosing the terminating facility based on the dialed digits is called translation. It works as follows. The dialled digits in the <font face="Courier New">call </font>table are compared to the
directory
numbers of the lines. If one matches then that is the line that was
called
and would be entered as the terminator of the call and the line's channel state
updated from IDLE to BUSY. If the called line however turns out to be BUSY, a busy
treatment
facility would be used as the terminator instead.</p>
<p>Suppose however a caller dials a number that is not
  among
  those of the lines. That means the digits represent a called party
  attached
  to
  another switch and so the call will connect to the appropriate
  trunk
  instead of a line. Trunks connect switches to each other and support
  up to 24 conversations at once. To select the appropriate trunk the <font face="Courier New">trunk_routes</font>
  table is used and is interpreted as follows.
</p>
<p>The preferred trunks to use in a call are those for
which
the area and office code match those of the dialled digits. Otherwise
(less
preferred) trunks that match the area code and have 000 for the office
code can be used. If there are no matches but a valid phone number was
dialled a trunk serving area=000 and office=000 can be used (least
preferred
option). Several trunks could satisfy any one of the above criteria
which would
make them an equally preferred choice.</p>
<p>The following problems must all be solved by
  coming up
  with the required SQL queries. If necessary you can create temporary
  tables.
  In each case show the output of the table that shows the result. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In all
    cases your query should still work if more data is added to the database or some 
    data deleted.</span> That
  is, don't
  hard code any data dependent values in the query based on what the tables 
  currently contain. </p>
<p class="red">(For these queries we will assume that an SQL CONTAINS operation is not 
  available -which it is not with SQLite, MySQL and many other relational database products).</p>
<p>For each problem you must provide a query script and sample output: Put your output as a comment at the bottom of the query script so we see it when it runs. Notice you are also asked to provide an english statement of the query with your script. That way when we run your script with .echo ON we will see the english statement, the query, your sample output and the actual output we get. Name your scripts <span class="code">P1_01.sql</span> for question 1 etc. So you will submit 10 individual script files each with the following format:</p>
<pre>
/*
Problem 1.3
List the names of all the subscribers who are originators of a call 
to someone who is also a subscriber on the same switch 
(i.e. a line to line call)
*/

SELECT portid, name from ...;

/*
Test Output:
name       
-----------
Mats Sundin
Jason Allis
Homer Simps
Michael Jor
Ed Belfour 
*/

</pre>
<p><span class="requirement">R1.1</span> <span class="red">[1 mark]</span> Include an

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.1</span> Produce a table consisting of the names and addresses of the subscribers and their phone 
  numbers.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.2</span> Produce a 
table that lists all the area code, office code combinations and the number of 
subscribers with that area code, office code combination. </p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.3</span> List the 
names of all the subscribers who are originators of a call to someone who is 
also a subscriber on the same switch (i.e. a line to line call)</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.4</span> Find
the names and address of all subscribers who subscribe to all of the available services. (Note the result for the current data might  be empty but your query should work if the TA's add more data to the databse.)</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.5</span> Find the names of all the subscribers who subscribe to at least 
three services. </p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.6</span> Produce a 
table that lists the most popular service (or services). That is, give the name 
of the service that has the most subscribers.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.7</span> Write an SQL query that will produce in one table a list of 
all the acceptable trunks that can be used to route a call to the 416 area code, 
office code 334. This query should list the trunks in the order of 
preference. (The answer should list trunks with routes 416,334 then those with 416,000 
and then those with 000,000 for example)</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.8</span> Write an SQL query that would find if the line with phone 
number (613) 712-0024 is currently available to take a call because its channel is IDLE. <span class="red">Rev 1: That is, select the portid, directory number, and channel state of line (613) 712-0024</span>.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.9</span> Do the same as question 1.7 but this time only include trunks that have at least one 'IDLE' channel. That is, write an SQL query that will produce in one table a list of 
all the acceptable trunks that can be used to route a call to the 416 area code, 
office code 334 have at least one idle channel. This query should list the trunks in the order of 
preference. (The answer should list trunks routes 416,334 then 416,000 
then 000,000 for example)</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 1.10</span> Produce a table that lists the name of all the 
service-subscribers that subscribe to at least all the same services as Jason Allison 
subscribes to but possibly others as well. Jason Allison rents the line with portID=2. (So this is the classic &quot;subset&quot; query.)</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Script to Create CDs Database</h2>
<p>In assignment 1 you were asked to provide sql scripts that would contribute two cds' worth of information to a database the contained a cds and songs table. The TA's ran your scripts and each produced a database consisting of the contributions of the students they marked. We have dumped those individual databases into SQL scripts. In this problem we want you to write a script that would read all those individual scripts and create one database with all the data for the entire class. Thus your script will have to read the individual scripts from all the TA and end up with a single database with all the data. Here are the specific requirements.</p>
<p><span class="requirement_danger">Intent Requirement </span>  Your script must read and make use of the TA files. That is, you cannot just cut and paste the information from these files and then ignore the files in your script. You script should work even if new contents is added to the TA files. <span class="requirement_danger">0 marks for this question if this requirement is not met.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 2.1</span> Your script should be called <span class="code">myTunes_assembly.sql</span> and my use both SQL commands and SQLite dot commands. They TA's will mark your script by executing.</p>
<p class="code">sqlite3 myTunes.db<br>
sqlite&gt;.read myTunes_assembly.sql</p>
<p>on the console. The TA scripts will be in the same directory as your myTunes_assembly.sql script. In the command above <span class="code">myTunes.db</span> could be either an non-existing database or a database that already contains a cds and songs table but these tables could be dropped by your script. This way the TA's can keep using the same database to run student scripts one after the other as each script would start by dropping the existing tables if they exist.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 2.2</span> You may not alter the files provided by the TA's in any way. When your script is being marked they will use their own copies of the files so any changes you make would not be picked up anyway. </p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 2.3</span> When your script has run the database should consist of ONLY at cds table and a songs table. There should not be any old or temporary tables that result from your script running. Your script can create other tables but must drop them before it completes.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 2.4</span> Your resulting database should contain all the data represented by the TA scripts.</p>
<p><span class="requirement">Problem 2.5</span> Your script should be itempotent and not throw any SQL errors when run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategy for solving these problems would involve creating and altering and dropping tables using SQL commands. Perhaps copying data from one table to another using sql like</p>
<p class="code">insert into table1 (col1, col2) select (colA,colB) from table 2;</p>
<p>Also your script would have muliple .read commands to read the posted TA scripts. <span class="red">(Some of which will be posted when this assignment is posted and the remaining will be posted while you are working on this as we still have not collected all of them.)</span></p>
