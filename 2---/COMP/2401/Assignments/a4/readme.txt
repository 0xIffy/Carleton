Purpose: simulate a randomized race between different runners clibming a mountain while dorcs come down to attack them, each runner and dorc has its own thread

Source Files:
	- main.c (implements the specified control flow for the overall prgram)
	- init.c (contains functions to do with initializing the used data types)
	- graphics.c (contains functions to do with initializing and updating the GUI and using the random number)
	- entity.c (cotains functions to do with interacting with the data and entities in the program (stores the thread functions for both runners and dorcs))

Header Files:
	- defs.h (contains the structure definitions for all custom data types used in the program. Also contains prototypes for all functions used)
	
Instructions:
- run the Makefile using the make command
- run the executable file that was created (a4).
